## Brief Introduction to `dplyr`

The learning curve for R syntax is slow. One of the more difficult aspects that requires some getting used to is subsetting data tables. The `dplyr` package brings these tasks closer to English and we are therefore going to introduce two simple functions: one is used to subset and the other to select columns.

Take a look at the dataset we read in:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
